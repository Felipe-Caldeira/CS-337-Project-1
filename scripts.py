# Scripts for information extraction
#
# Each list of scripts is composed of tuples, each containing a regex string and a 'priority' score.
# Common regex strings are abstracted here as [NAME], [PERSON], and [AWARD], which are converted to actual
# regex patterns in scriptToRegex().

# [NAME]   - Pattern for the general name of a person, movie, or show.
# [PERSON] - Pattern for the name of a person (structured as "firstname lastname")
# [AWARD]  - A variable which is used in scripts other than AWARDS; represents the name of an award (found through 
# findAward()) which is passed into scriptToRegex() to make the actual award_name be a part of the pattern.

# Awards
AWARDS = [
